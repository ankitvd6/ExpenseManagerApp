An application keep a track of your expenses with crud features along with search features. Built using **Angular**.
This is my first angular single page application project. Currently it does not have a feature to store your expenses. But very soon an updated version of this will be having features like: 
1. Ability to save the expenses.
2. **Login and logout** using Google's Firebase.
3. Different expense history for different users.

To add feature to this app you can clone this into your local workspace. Or directly fork it into your own github repository and then add features to it and create a Pull request along with details of what is the PR is for.
